# Human Escalation

AI does the work. Humans make decisions. Route to Slack, email, SMS with full audit trail.

```typescript
import { legal, ceo } from 'humans.do'

const approved = await ceo`approve the partnership with ${company}`
const reviewed = await legal`review ${contract}`
```

---

## When AI Needs Humans

Some decisions shouldn't be automated:
- High-value transactions
- Legal or compliance matters
- Edge cases outside training data
- Customer escalations
- Strategic decisions

---

## Human Functions

Define when to escalate.

```typescript
import { Human } from 'dotdo'

export class RefundApprover extends Human {
  trigger = 'refund > $10000'
  role = 'senior-accountant'
  sla = '4 hours'

  channels = ['slack', 'email']
}
```

When triggered:
1. Slack notification to `#accounting`
2. Email to on-call accountant
3. SLA countdown starts
4. Full context attached

## Escalation Channels

<FeatureGrid cols={3}>
  <Feature icon="Slack" title="Slack">
    Interactive buttons. Thread replies. Real-time.
  </Feature>
  <Feature icon="Mail" title="Email">
    Rich HTML. Attachments. Reply to respond.
  </Feature>
  <Feature icon="Phone" title="SMS">
    Urgent alerts. Quick approvals. Y/N responses.
  </Feature>
</FeatureGrid>

## The Decision Loop

```typescript
export class ContractReview extends Workflow {
  async run(contract: Contract) {
    // AI does initial analysis
    const analysis = await tom`analyze risks in ${contract}`

    // Route based on risk level
    if (analysis.riskLevel === 'high') {
      return await legal`review ${contract} with ${analysis}`
    }

    // Low risk: auto-approve
    return { approved: true, analysis }
  }
}
```

---

## Audit Trail

Every human decision is logged:

```typescript
{
  decision: 'approved',
  human: 'jane@company.com',
  timestamp: '2024-01-15T14:32:00Z',
  context: { contractId: 'abc123', amount: 50000 },
  reasoning: 'Standard terms, existing customer',
  channel: 'slack',
  responseTime: '2h 15m'
}
```

---

## SLA Management

Define response time expectations.

```typescript
export class UrgentApproval extends Human {
  sla = '1 hour'

  onSlaBreached = async () => {
    // Escalate to manager
    await manager`urgent: ${this.request} needs approval`
  }

  onSlaWarning = async () => {
    // Send reminder at 50% of SLA
    await this.remind()
  }
}
```

---

## Role-Based Routing

Route to the right human based on context.

```typescript
export class ExpenseApproval extends Human {
  async route(expense: Expense) {
    if (expense.amount > 50000) {
      return 'cfo'
    }
    if (expense.amount > 10000) {
      return 'finance-manager'
    }
    return 'team-lead'
  }
}
```

---

## Hybrid Teams

Mix AI agents and humans seamlessly.

```typescript
import { priya, ralph } from 'agents.do'
import { cto, designer } from 'humans.do'

export class ProductDevelopment extends Workflow {
  async run(idea: string) {
    // AI: spec and build
    const spec = await priya`define ${idea}`
    const prototype = await ralph`build ${spec}`

    // Human: design review
    const design = await designer`review UX of ${prototype}`

    // AI: implement feedback
    const final = await ralph`implement ${design.feedback}`

    // Human: final approval
    return await cto`approve for production: ${final}`
  }
}
```
