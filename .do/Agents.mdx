# Meet Your AI Team

Named agents with real identity. Not chatbots—workers.

```typescript
import { priya, ralph, tom, mark, sally, quinn } from 'agents.do'

// Template literal syntax for natural requests
const spec = await priya`define the MVP for ${hypothesis}`
const code = await ralph`build ${spec}`
const review = await tom`review ${code}`
```

## The Team

<AgentGrid>
  <AgentProfile name="Priya" role="Product Manager" avatar="/agents/priya.png">
    **Specs, roadmaps, priorities.** Priya turns your hypothesis into actionable specs. She thinks in user stories, not features.

    ```typescript
    await priya`what should we build next?`
    await priya`prioritize the backlog for ${sprint}`
    await priya`write acceptance criteria for ${feature}`
    ```
  </AgentProfile>

  <AgentProfile name="Ralph" role="Engineer" avatar="/agents/ralph.png">
    **Builds what you need.** Ralph writes production code. Tests included. He prefers simple solutions.

    ```typescript
    await ralph`build ${spec}`
    await ralph`fix the bug in ${component}`
    await ralph`add tests for ${module}`
    ```
  </AgentProfile>

  <AgentProfile name="Tom" role="Tech Lead" avatar="/agents/tom.png">
    **Architecture, code review.** Tom reviews PRs, designs systems, and catches edge cases before they become incidents.

    ```typescript
    await tom`review ${pullRequest}`
    await tom`design the architecture for ${system}`
    await tom`ship ${app}` // Review + merge + deploy
    ```
  </AgentProfile>

  <AgentProfile name="Rae" role="Frontend" avatar="/agents/rae.png">
    **React, UI, accessibility.** Rae builds interfaces. She cares about UX, responsiveness, and a11y.

    ```typescript
    await rae`build the ${component} component`
    await rae`make ${page} responsive`
    await rae`audit accessibility for ${app}`
    ```
  </AgentProfile>

  <AgentProfile name="Mark" role="Marketing" avatar="/agents/mark.png">
    **Copy, content, launches.** Mark writes landing pages, blog posts, and launch announcements.

    ```typescript
    await mark`announce the launch`
    await mark`write a blog post about ${feature}`
    await mark`create copy for ${campaign}`
    ```
  </AgentProfile>

  <AgentProfile name="Sally" role="Sales" avatar="/agents/sally.png">
    **Outreach, demos, closing.** Sally handles cold outreach, schedules demos, and follows up.

    ```typescript
    await sally`start selling`
    await sally`reach out to ${leads}`
    await sally`follow up with ${prospect}`
    ```
  </AgentProfile>

  <AgentProfile name="Quinn" role="QA" avatar="/agents/quinn.png">
    **Testing, edge cases, quality.** Quinn finds bugs before users do. She thinks like an attacker.

    ```typescript
    await quinn`test ${feature}`
    await quinn`find edge cases in ${spec}`
    await quinn`write e2e tests for ${flow}`
    ```
  </AgentProfile>
</AgentGrid>

## Real Identity

Each agent has:
- **GitHub account** — `@priya-do`, `@ralph-do`, etc.
- **Email** — `priya@agents.do`
- **Avatar** — Consistent across all platforms
- **Audit trail** — Full history of actions

When Tom reviews your PR, you see `@tom-do` commenting. Not "AI Assistant".

---

## Pipeline Execution

Agents compose with promise pipelining. One network round trip, not N.

```typescript
// This is ONE batch operation
const sprint = await priya`plan the sprint`
  .map(issue => ralph`build ${issue}`)
  .map(code => tom`review ${code}`)
  .map(pr => tom`merge ${pr}`)

// Not N separate API calls
```

The `.map()` isn't JavaScript. It's a **Magic Map** that sends your callback to the server.

---

## Custom Agents

Build domain-specific agents for your industry.

```typescript
import { Agent } from 'dotdo'

export class LegalReviewer extends Agent {
  name = 'Lexi'
  role = 'Legal'

  systemPrompt = `You review contracts and legal documents.
    Flag risks. Suggest revisions. Never give legal advice.`
}

// Use it
const reviewed = await lexi`review ${contract}`
```
