# Build your 1-Person Unicorn.

Deploy a startup with product, engineering, marketing, and sales.
It's Tuesday. You're one person.

```typescript
import { Startup } from 'dotdo'
import { priya, ralph, tom, mark, sally } from 'agents.do'

export class MyStartup extends Startup {
  async launch() {
    const spec = await priya`define the MVP for ${this.hypothesis}`
    const app = await ralph`build ${spec}`
    const reviewed = await tom`ship ${app}`

    await mark`announce the launch`
    await sally`start selling`

    // Your business is running. Go back to bed.
  }
}
```

## How This Actually Works

Built on [Cap'n Web](https://github.com/cloudflare/capnweb)—object-capability RPC with promise pipelining.

```typescript
// This runs as a single batch, not N separate calls
const sprint = await priya`plan the sprint`
  .map(issue => ralph`build ${issue}`)
  .map(code => tom`review ${code}`)
```

The `.map()` isn't JavaScript's array method. It's a **Magic Map** that records your callback, sends it to the server, and replays it for each result. All in one network round trip.

## Meet Your Team

<AgentGrid>
  <Agent name="Priya" role="Product" avatar="P">specs, roadmaps, priorities</Agent>
  <Agent name="Ralph" role="Engineering" avatar="R">builds what you need</Agent>
  <Agent name="Tom" role="Tech Lead" avatar="T">architecture, code review</Agent>
  <Agent name="Rae" role="Frontend" avatar="R">React, UI, accessibility</Agent>
  <Agent name="Mark" role="Marketing" avatar="M">copy, content, launches</Agent>
  <Agent name="Sally" role="Sales" avatar="S">outreach, demos, closing</Agent>
  <Agent name="Quinn" role="QA" avatar="Q">testing, edge cases, quality</Agent>
</AgentGrid>

Each agent has real identity—email, GitHub account, avatar. When Tom reviews your PR, you see `@tom-do` commenting. They're not chatbots. They're workers.

## The $ Context

Every Durable Object has a workflow context that handles execution, events, and scheduling. No boilerplate. Infinite combinations.

```typescript
// Three durability levels
$.send(event)              // Fire-and-forget
$.try(action)              // Single attempt
$.do(action)               // Durable with retries

// Event handlers via proxy
$.on.Customer.signup(handler)
$.on.Payment.failed(handler)

// Scheduling
$.every.monday.at('9am')(handler)
```

## Why We Rebuilt Everything

Traditional infrastructure crumbles under 10,000 parallel AI agents. We rebuilt on V8 isolates—virtual Chrome tabs with durable state, running on the edge.

<FeatureGrid>
  <Feature icon="⚡" title="Promise Pipelining">
    Multiple agent calls execute in one network round trip. The server receives your entire pipeline and runs it in a single pass.
  </Feature>
  <Feature icon="🗺️" title="Magic Map">
    The .map() isn't JavaScript's array method. It records your callback, sends it to the server, and replays it for each result.
  </Feature>
  <Feature icon="🌐" title="V8 Isolates">
    Virtual Chrome tabs with persistent state. 0ms cold starts. Runs in 300+ cities worldwide.
  </Feature>
  <Feature icon="🔌" title="38 Compat SDKs">
    Use APIs you know—Supabase, MongoDB, Kafka, Redis. Same code, scales to millions of agents.
  </Feature>
  <Feature icon="🧱" title="Extended Primitives">
    fsx (filesystem), gitx (version control), bashx (shell)—all rebuilt for edge without VMs.
  </Feature>
  <Feature icon="👤" title="Human Escalation">
    AI does the work. Humans make decisions. Route to Slack, email, SMS with full audit trail.
