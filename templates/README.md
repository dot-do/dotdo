## The Story

You want to build something great. You have the vision, the skills, the drive.

What you don't have is months to spend on infrastructure.

**These templates give you that time back.**

## What's Included

Every template comes with:

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Database** | SQLite per Durable Object instance. No setup. Infinite scale. |
| **Auth** | org.ai integration for humans + AI agents |
| **API** | Hono-powered, type-safe, auto-documented |
| **Website** | Your content, deployed globally |
| **Admin** | Dashboard for managing your app |
| **SDK** | Auto-generated client for your API |
| **CLI** | Power-user access to everything |
| **MCP** | AI agents can use your app natively |

## Choose Your Template

### `mdx` (Recommended)

Content-first. Perfect for:
- Landing pages
- Documentation
- Blogs
- Marketing sites
- Apps where content matters

```bash
npm create do my-app
```

### `ts`

TypeScript. Perfect for:
- APIs
- Backend services
- Complex business logic
- Full type safety

```bash
npm create do my-app --template ts
```

### `js`

JavaScript. Perfect for:
- Quick prototypes
- Simple services
- When you want minimal setup

```bash
npm create do my-app --template js
```

## From Zero to Deployed

```bash
npm create do my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev     # localhost:8787
npm run deploy  # live worldwide
```

**Total time: ~2 minutes.**

## What You're Really Getting

Not just a template. A **head start**.

Every hour you'd spend on boilerplate is an hour you can spend on what matters—your idea, your users, your business.
