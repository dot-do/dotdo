Should use Drizzle Kit migrations per https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/connect-cloudflare-do\n\nTasks:\n1. Add drizzle.config.ts for sqlite-core with DO settings\n2. Generate migrations from existing Drizzle schemas (schema-minimal.ts, etc.)\n3. Replace initSchema() with migrate() from drizzle-orm/durable-sqlite/migrator\n4. Use blockConcurrencyWhile() for safe migration application\n5. Delete db/schema-init.ts after migration\n\nBenefits:\n- Single source of truth (TypeScript schemas)\n- Proper versioned migrations\n- ALTER TABLE support for schema evolution\n- Better DX with drizzle-kit push/generate","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"subagent","created_at":"2026-01-14T05:30:22.576857-06:00","updated_at":"2026-01-14T05:39:25.818385-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-14T05:39:25.818385-06:00","close_reason":"Implemented Drizzle Kit migrations in 3 commits"}
