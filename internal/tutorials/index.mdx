## What You'll Learn

Every tutorial demonstrates core dotdo patterns:

### The do...while Review Loop

```typescript
do {
  app = ralph`improve ${app} per ${tom}`
} while (!await tom.approve(app))
```

Build-review-improve cycles with a single await. Tom reviews, Ralph improves, repeat until shipped.

### Fire-and-Forget Operations

```typescript
// Non-blocking - run in background
mark`announce the launch of ${product}`
sally`send welcome email to ${customer}`

// No await. They run. You move on.
```

Some things don't need to block. Announcements, notifications, emails - fire-and-forget.

### Agent Collaboration

```typescript
const spec = priya`define the checkout flow`
const code = ralph`build ${spec}`
const tests = quinn`write tests for ${code}`
await tom`review and ship ${code} with ${tests}`
```

Priya specs it. Ralph builds it. Quinn tests it. Tom ships it. One line each.

### The $ Context

```typescript
// Events
$.on.Order.placed(order => sally`confirm ${order}`)

// Scheduling
$.every.monday.at('9am')(() => priya`review the roadmap`)

// Durability
await $.do('processPayment', { amount, customerId })
```

Events, scheduling, durability - all through `$`.

## Prerequisites

Before starting any tutorial:

```bash
# Install dotdo CLI
npm install -g dotdo

# Verify installation
dotdo --version
```

You'll also need:
- Node.js 18+
- A Cloudflare account (free tier works)
- API keys for your chosen providers (we'll guide you)

---

## Tutorial Structure

Each tutorial follows the same pattern:

1. **Create** - Initialize the project
2. **Configure** - Set up auth, payments, etc.
3. **Build** - Write the core logic with agents
4. **Test** - Run locally, verify it works
5. **Deploy** - Ship to Cloudflare's edge

By the end, you'll have:
- Working code in your repo
- A deployed product at `your-app.workers.dev`
- An AI team managing operations
