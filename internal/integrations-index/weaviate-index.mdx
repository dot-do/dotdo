# Weaviate Integration

dotdo provides two ways to work with Weaviate-compatible vector search APIs:

| | @dotdo/weaviate | weaviate.do |
|---|-----------------|-------------|
| **Type** | OSS npm package | Managed edge service |
| **Storage** | In-memory | Durable Object SQLite |
| **Persistence** | None (resets on restart) | Full durability |
| **Use case** | Testing, prototyping | Production workloads |
| **Infrastructure** | Zero | Zero (we manage it) |
| **Install** | `npm install @dotdo/weaviate` | Deploy to Cloudflare |

## Quick Comparison

```typescript
// @dotdo/weaviate - In-memory, great for tests
import weaviate from '@dotdo/weaviate'

const client = weaviate.client({ host: 'localhost:8080' })
await client.data.creator()
  .withClassName('Article')
  .withProperties({ title: 'Test' })
  .withVector([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])
  .do()
// Data lost on restart
```

```typescript
// weaviate.do - Persistent edge vector database
import weaviate from 'weaviate.do'

const client = weaviate.client({ host: 'https://your-worker.workers.dev' })
await client.data.creator()
  .withClassName('Article')
  .withProperties({ title: 'Production' })
  .withVector([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])
  .do()
// Data persists globally
```

## When to Use Each

### Use @dotdo/weaviate when:

- **Unit testing** - Fast, isolated tests without external dependencies
- **Prototyping** - Quick iteration without infrastructure setup
- **Edge functions** - Need Weaviate API but no persistence required
- **CI/CD pipelines** - Tests that need vector search semantics

<Callout type="info">
@dotdo/weaviate is a complete in-memory Weaviate implementation backed by EdgeVec. Perfect for tests and development, but data doesn't persist between restarts.
</Callout>

### Use weaviate.do when:

- **Production applications** - Real user data that must persist
- **Global edge deployment** - Vector search close to users worldwide
- **AI/Agent workloads** - RAG, semantic search, recommendation systems
- **Hybrid search** - Combined vector + keyword search with BM25

<Callout type="info">
weaviate.do is Weaviate on the Edge - a fully managed service running on Cloudflare's global network with zero infrastructure to manage.
</Callout>

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | @dotdo/weaviate | weaviate.do |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| Schema CRUD | Full | Full |
| Data CRUD | Full | Full |
| Batch Operations | Full | Full |
| nearVector Search | Full | Full |
| nearObject Search | Full | Full |
| BM25 Keyword Search | Full | Full |
| Hybrid Search | Full | Full |
| Where Filters | Full | Full |
| Aggregations | Partial (count) | Full |
| Cross-references | Not yet | Full |
| Multi-tenancy | Not yet | Full |
| Generative Modules | Not yet | Planned |
| Wire Protocol | Not yet | Full (Weaviate clients) |
| Real-time Updates | Not yet | Full (change streams) |

## Migration Path

Start with `@dotdo/weaviate` for development, then upgrade to `weaviate.do` for production:

```typescript
// Development (package)
import weaviate from '@dotdo/weaviate'
const client = weaviate.client({ host: 'localhost:8080' })

// Production (service) - same API!
import weaviate from 'weaviate.do'
const client = weaviate.client({ host: 'https://your-worker.workers.dev' })

// Your application code stays the same
const results = await client.graphql.get()
  .withClassName('Article')
  .withFields('title content _additional { distance }')
  .withNearVector({ vector: queryEmbedding })
  .withLimit(10)
  .do()
```

Both packages share the same Weaviate-compatible API, making migration seamless.
