# dotdo Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the architecture and implementation plan for dotdo - a batteries-included framework for vibe coders to build Autonomous Businesses.

## Core Value Proposition

**Infrastructure-as-Code unlocked SaaS. Business-as-Code unlocks Services-as-Software.**

Just as Terraform made infrastructure programmable, dotdo makes businesses programmable. The result: Autonomous Businesses managed entirely by AI agents, escalating to humans only for sensitive decisions.

```typescript
import { Startup } from 'dotdo'
import { priya, ralph, tom, mark, sally } from 'agents.do'

export class TaxPrepAI extends Startup {
  hypothesis = 'Freelancers hate tax season - AI does 95%, CPA reviews edge cases'

  async launch() {
    const spec = priya`define the MVP for ${this.hypothesis}`
    let app = ralph`build ${spec}`

    do {
      app = ralph`improve ${app} per ${tom}`
    } while (!await tom.approve(app))

    mark`announce the launch`
    sally`start selling`
  }
}
```

## The Journey: Three Phases

dotdo guides vibe coders through three distinct phases, each building on the last:

<Cards>
  <Card title="1. Foundation Sprint" href="/docs/roadmap/foundation-sprint">
    Go from vague idea to testable Founding Hypothesis. Customer definition, problem clarity, differentiation mapping.
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. Experimentation Machine" href="/docs/roadmap/experimentation-machine">
    Find product-market fit through systematic A/B testing, HUNCH metrics, and learning loops.
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. Autonomous Business" href="/docs/roadmap/autonomous-business">
    Deploy businesses that run autonomously. AI agents operate, humans escalate only for sensitive decisions.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Key Concepts

### Business-as-Code

Define businesses programmatically. Not just workflows - entire business models, pricing, operations, and growth strategies as code.

```typescript
// A complete business definition
export class ConsultingFirm extends Startup {
  pricing = $.plan({
    starter: { price: 199, features: ['2 projects/mo', 'Email support'] },
    growth: { price: 499, features: ['10 projects/mo', 'Slack support'] },
    scale: { price: 1499, features: ['Unlimited', '24/7 support', 'Dedicated agent'] },
  })

  // Revenue flows, profit compounds
  async operate() {
    $.on.Customer.signup(customer => agents.onboarding.welcome(customer))
    $.on.Project.submitted(project => agents.delivery.execute(project))
    $.on.Invoice.overdue(invoice => agents.collections.followUp(invoice))
  }
}
```

### Services-as-Software

Professional services delivered by AI agents. Tax preparation, legal review, bookkeeping, consulting - all automated with human oversight for edge cases.

```typescript
// Tax prep as a software service
$.on.TaxReturn.submitted(async (taxReturn) => {
  const analysis = await agents.tax.analyze(taxReturn)

  if (analysis.auditRisk > 0.8) {
    // Human CPA reviews high-risk returns
    await $.escalate(cpa, 'Review high-risk return', taxReturn)
  } else {
    // AI handles straightforward cases
    await agents.tax.prepare(taxReturn)
  }
})
```

### HumanFunction

Not a fallback for bad AI - **deliberate oversight** for sensitive decisions. Designed into the system from the start.

```typescript
// Explicit escalation policies
escalation = this.HumanFunction({
  trigger: 'refund > $10000 OR audit_risk > 0.8',
  role: 'senior-accountant',
  sla: '4 hours',
  channels: ['slack', 'email'],
})
```

## Platform Architecture

dotdo provides everything needed to build and run Autonomous Businesses:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Business-as-Code Primitives" href="/docs/roadmap/primitives">
    Core building blocks: Startup, Agent, Human, Workflow. Extended primitives: fsx, gitx, bashx. 40+ compat SDKs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Platform Services" href="/docs/roadmap/platform-services">
    Auth, billing, analytics, observability, real-time sync, search - all built-in.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Surfaces (MDXUI)" href="/docs/ui">
    Sites for customers (Beacon), apps for operators (Cockpit). 30 theme presets.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Developer Experience" href="/docs/getting-started">
    CLI, templates, playground, documentation. Zero to deployed in under an hour.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Implementation Priorities

The roadmap is organized into phases that progressively unlock the full vision:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

Core primitives and infrastructure that everything else depends on:

| Epic | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| [Business-as-Code Primitives](/docs/roadmap/primitives) | DO base, Startup class, $ context, compat SDKs | In Progress |
| [File Convention System](/docs/concepts) | .ts/.mdx/.md files for business primitives | Planned |
| [Developer Experience](/docs/getting-started) | CLI, templates, playground, docs | In Progress |

### Phase 2: Journey

The three-phase user journey from idea to profitable business:

| Epic | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| [Foundation Sprint](/docs/roadmap/foundation-sprint) | From idea to Founding Hypothesis | Planned |
| [Experimentation Machine](/docs/roadmap/experimentation-machine) | From hypothesis to validated PMF | Planned |
| [Autonomous Business](/docs/roadmap/autonomous-business) | From PMF to profitable operation | Planned |

### Phase 3: Platform Services

Cross-cutting capabilities for production businesses:

| Epic | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| [Platform Services](/docs/roadmap/platform-services) | Auth, billing, analytics, observability | Planned |
| [Surfaces (MDXUI)](/docs/ui) | Sites, apps, theme system | In Progress |
| [AI Agent Memory & Safety](/docs/agents) | Memory architecture, guardrails, observability | Planned |

### Phase 4: Ecosystem

Connections to the broader platform:

| Epic | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| [StartupBuilder Integration](/docs/roadmap/foundation-sprint#startupbuilder) | 150K+ ideas from O*NET/NAICS/Zapier | Planned |
| [SalesBuilder Integration](/docs/roadmap/autonomous-business#salesbuilder) | GTM automation | Planned |
| [Visual Workflow Builder](/docs/workflows) | n8n-inspired no-code builder | Planned |

### Phase 5: Enterprise & Growth

Features for scale and enterprise adoption:

| Epic | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| [SOC2 Compliance](/docs/security/compliance) | Automated evidence collection, trust center | Planned |
| [Business Formation](/docs/roadmap/autonomous-business#formation) | Legal infrastructure, Stripe Connect | Planned |
| [Documentation Overhaul](/docs) | 4 audience paths | In Progress |
| [Templates & Starters](/docs/getting-started) | One-click deploy | Planned |

## Success Metrics

The platform measures success through the **HUNCH** metrics framework:

| Metric | Question | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **H**air-on-Fire | Is this a must-have problem? | >70% say "very disappointed" if gone |
| **U**sage | Are they actively using it? | >40% weekly active |
| **N**PS | Would they recommend it? | >50 NPS |
| **C**hurn | Are they staying? | <5% monthly |
| **H**LTV/CAC | Is it profitable? | >3x ratio |

<Callout type="info">
These metrics apply both to dotdo as a platform AND to the Autonomous Businesses built on it. The Experimentation Machine helps vibe coders measure their own HUNCH scores.
