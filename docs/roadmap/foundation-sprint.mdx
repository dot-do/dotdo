# Foundation Sprint

The Foundation Sprint helps vibe coders figure out **WHAT to build** before they build it. Based on Jake Knapp's "Click" methodology, it compresses months of wandering into focused clarity.

<Callout type="warn">
Most startups fail because they build the wrong thing. The Foundation Sprint exists to prevent this - it's the most important phase of your journey.
</Callout>

## The Problem

You have an idea. Maybe it's vague ("something with AI for small businesses") or specific ("AI-powered tax prep for freelancers"). Either way, you're not ready to code yet.

Building without clarity leads to:
- Wasted months on features nobody wants
- Pivots that could have been avoided
- Running out of runway before finding fit

The Foundation Sprint gives you a **Founding Hypothesis** - a testable statement about who you're building for, what problem you're solving, and why you'll win.

## The Founding Hypothesis

A Founding Hypothesis has three components:

```typescript
const hypothesis = await $.foundation({
  customer: 'Freelance developers who hate tax season',
  problem: 'Spending 20+ hours on taxes instead of shipping',
  differentiation: 'AI does 95%, human CPA reviews edge cases',
})
```

### Customer

Who exactly are you building for? Not "small businesses" - that's too broad. Be specific:

| Too Broad | Better | Best |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Small businesses | Freelancers | Freelance developers with >$100K revenue |
| Agencies | Marketing agencies | 5-20 person agencies with retainer clients |
| Startups | SaaS companies | Seed-stage SaaS with 10-100 customers |

### Problem

What problem are they desperate to solve? The best problems are:

- **Hair-on-fire** - They need a solution NOW
- **Frequent** - They encounter it regularly
- **Expensive** - Current solutions cost time or money

| Weak Problem | Strong Problem |
|--------------|----------------|
| "Taxes are annoying" | "I spent 20 hours last month on QuickBooks" |
| "Hiring is hard" | "My last 3 hires quit within 6 months" |
| "Marketing takes time" | "I've posted 0 times in 3 months despite knowing I should" |

### Differentiation

Why will you win? The best differentiators are:

- **Defensible** - Hard for competitors to copy
- **Believable** - Customers understand why it's better
- **Measurable** - You can prove the difference

## The Sprint Process

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Customer Definition (Day 1)

    Who is your ideal customer? Use the Customer Canvas to map:

    ```typescript
    const customer = await priya`define ideal customer for ${idea}`

    // Output: CustomerCanvas
    {
      demographics: 'Freelance developers, US-based, $100K-500K revenue',
      behaviors: 'Uses Linear for tasks, ships weekly, active on Twitter',
      painPoints: ['Tax complexity', 'Quarterly estimates', 'Deduction tracking'],
      currentSolutions: ['TurboTax', 'CPA ($2K/year)', 'DIY spreadsheets'],
      willingness: '$500-2000/year for a great solution',
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Problem Clarity (Day 2)

    Map the problem space. What are they struggling with? How painful is it?

    ```typescript
    const problem = await priya`analyze problem space for ${customer}`

    // Output: ProblemMap
    {
      core: 'Tax preparation takes 20+ hours and causes anxiety',
      frequency: 'Quarterly + annual = 5x/year',
      severity: 'High - IRS penalties for mistakes',
      currentCost: '$2000/year CPA OR 80+ hours DIY',
      alternatives: [
        { solution: 'TurboTax', gap: 'Still takes 10+ hours, misses deductions' },
        { solution: 'CPA', gap: 'Expensive, slow turnaround' },
        { solution: 'DIY', gap: 'Error-prone, anxiety-inducing' },
      ],
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Differentiation Mapping (Day 3)

    How will you be 10x better? Use the 2x2 framework and Magic Lenses.

    **2x2 Framework:**
    Plot competitors on two axes that matter to customers.

    ```
                 High Touch
                     |
         CPA         |    Your Solution
         (expensive) |    (AI + CPA review)
    ------------------+-------------------
         DIY         |    TurboTax
         (free)      |    (self-service)
                     |
                 Low Touch
    ```

    **Magic Lenses:**
    - What if it was **instant** instead of taking weeks?
    - What if it was **$99** instead of $2000?
    - What if it **prevented mistakes** instead of just finding them?

    ```typescript
    const differentiation = await priya`find differentiation for ${customer} solving ${problem}`

    // Output: DifferentiationMap
    {
      primaryAxis: 'Speed (instant vs weeks)',
      secondaryAxis: 'Accuracy (AI-verified vs human error)',
      yourPosition: 'Instant + AI-verified with human review for edge cases',
      competitors: [
        { name: 'TurboTax', position: 'Fast but error-prone' },
        { name: 'CPA', position: 'Accurate but slow and expensive' },
      ],
      defensibility: 'Training data from 100K+ tax returns',
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Founding Hypothesis (Day 4)

    Synthesize everything into a testable hypothesis.

    ```typescript
    const hypothesis = await $.foundation({
      customer: 'Freelance developers with >$100K revenue',
      problem: 'Spending 20+ hours on taxes instead of shipping',
      differentiation: 'AI does 95% in minutes, human CPA reviews edge cases',
    })

    // Output: FoundingHypothesis
    {
      statement: 'Freelance developers with >$100K revenue will pay $500/year for AI tax prep that takes 15 minutes instead of 20 hours, with human CPA review for edge cases.',
      assumptions: [
        'They currently spend 20+ hours on taxes',
        'They value time at >$100/hour',
        'They trust AI with financial data if human-reviewed',
      ],
      tests: [
        { assumption: 'Time spent', method: 'Survey 50 freelancers' },
        { assumption: 'Price sensitivity', method: 'Landing page A/B test' },
        { assumption: 'AI trust', method: 'Prototype user testing' },
      ],
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Validation Plan (Day 5)

    How will you test the hypothesis? The Experimentation Machine will run these tests.

    ```typescript
    const validation = await priya`create validation plan for ${hypothesis}`

    // Output: ValidationPlan
    {
      tests: [
        {
          name: 'Landing page conversion',
          hypothesis: '$500/year pricing converts at 5%+',
          method: 'A/B test with $299, $499, $799 variants',
          successCriteria: '>3% conversion to waitlist',
          duration: '2 weeks',
        },
        {
          name: 'Smoke test',
          hypothesis: 'Users will submit real tax data',
          method: 'Build minimal upload flow, measure submissions',
          successCriteria: '>10% of waitlist submits data',
          duration: '2 weeks',
        },
      ],
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## StartupBuilder Integration

dotdo integrates with [StartupBuilder](https://startupbuilder.io) to help generate and refine ideas:

### 150K+ Startup Ideas

StartupBuilder has mapped startup opportunities from:
- **O*NET** - 1,000+ occupations and their pain points
- **NAICS** - 20,000+ industry classifications
- **Zapier** - 7,000+ SaaS apps and their integration needs

```typescript
// Browse ideas by category
const ideas = await $.startupBuilder.browse({
  category: 'professional-services',
  opportunity: 'automation',
})

// Get specific idea details
const idea = await $.startupBuilder.get('freelancer-tax-prep')
// Returns: customer, problem, market size, competitors, differentiation angles
```

### LeanCanvas Generation

Automatically generate a LeanCanvas from your Founding Hypothesis:

```typescript
const canvas = await priya`create LeanCanvas for ${hypothesis}`

// Output: LeanCanvas
{
  problem: ['20+ hours on taxes', 'Anxiety about mistakes', 'Missed deductions'],
  customerSegments: ['Freelance developers', '$100K+ revenue', 'US-based'],
  uniqueValueProposition: 'AI tax prep in 15 minutes with CPA review',
  solution: ['Auto-categorize expenses', 'AI form filling', 'CPA edge case review'],
  channels: ['Twitter/X ads', 'Dev communities', 'Tax season SEO'],
  revenueStreams: ['$500/year subscription', '$99 one-time returns'],
  costStructure: ['AI compute', 'CPA network', 'Customer support'],
  keyMetrics: ['Time saved', 'Accuracy rate', 'NPS'],
  unfairAdvantage: ['Training data from 100K returns', 'CPA network'],
}
```

### StoryBrand Framework

Clarify your messaging with the StoryBrand framework:

```typescript
const story = await mark`create StoryBrand for ${hypothesis}`

// Output: StoryBrand
{
  character: 'A freelance developer who wants to spend time coding, not on taxes',
  problem: {
    external: 'Tax prep takes 20+ hours',
    internal: 'Anxiety about making mistakes',
    philosophical: 'Creators should create, not do paperwork',
  },
  guide: 'TaxPrepAI - AI that handles your taxes while you ship',
  plan: ['Upload expenses', 'AI prepares return', 'CPA reviews edge cases'],
  callToAction: 'Get your taxes done in 15 minutes',
  failure: 'Miss deadlines, overpay taxes, face IRS audits',
  success: 'Ship code while AI handles taxes, maximize deductions',
}
```

## Output: Ready for Experimentation

The Foundation Sprint produces:

1. **Founding Hypothesis** - Testable statement about customer, problem, differentiation
2. **Customer Canvas** - Deep understanding of who you're building for
3. **Problem Map** - Clear picture of the pain and current alternatives
4. **Differentiation Map** - Why you'll win
5. **Validation Plan** - Tests to run in the Experimentation Machine
6. **LeanCanvas** - One-page business model
7. **StoryBrand** - Messaging framework

With these artifacts, you're ready to move to the [Experimentation Machine](/docs/roadmap/experimentation-machine) and start testing your hypothesis systematically.
