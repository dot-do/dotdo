# Thing

The `Thing` interface is the base entity type in dotdo. Every entity in the system extends from Thing, which provides URL-based identity and standard CRUD operations.

## Overview

Things have fully qualified URL identities (`$id`) and type identifiers (`$type`). They can contain relationships to other Things and can be promoted to their own Durable Objects.

## ThingData Interface

The data portion of a Thing, containing core fields and git provenance.

<AutoTypeTable type="ThingData" />

### Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `$id` | `string` | Yes | Fully qualified URL identity |
| `$type` | `string` | Yes | Type URL (Noun URL) |
| `name` | `string` | No | Display name |
| `data` | `Record<string, unknown>` | No | Custom data fields |
| `meta` | `Record<string, unknown>` | No | Metadata |
| `$source` | `object` | No | Git provenance when synced from git |
| `createdAt` | `Date` | Yes | Creation timestamp |
| `updatedAt` | `Date` | Yes | Last update timestamp |

## Thing Interface

The full Thing interface extends ThingData with identity helpers, relationships, and operations.

<AutoTypeTable type="Thing" />

### Identity

- `identity` - Computed identity object from `$id`
- `isDO` - Whether this Thing is a Durable Object

### Relationships

- `relationships` - Outbound edges by verb (camelCase)
- `references` - Inbound edges by reverse verb

### Operations

- `update(data)` - Update this Thing
- `delete()` - Delete this Thing
- `promote()` - Promote to its own DO
- `relate(verb, to)` - Create a relationship
- `unrelate(verb, to)` - Remove a relationship

## ThingDO Interface

A Thing that has been promoted to its own Durable Object (namespace).

<AutoTypeTable type="ThingDO" />

### Additional Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `isDO` | `true` | Always true for ThingDO |
| `$git` | `object` | Git binding information |
| `$parent` | `ThingDO` | Parent DO relationship |
| `$children` | `ThingDO[]` | Child DOs |

### Methods

- `collection(noun)` - Get a collection of Things by noun

## Usage Examples

```typescript
// Access a Thing's identity
const thing: Thing = await $.Thing('user-123')
console.log(thing.$id) // 'https://example.com/user-123'
console.log(thing.identity.ns) // 'https://example.com'

// Update a Thing
await thing.update({ name: 'New Name' })

// Create relationships
await thing.relate('manages', 'https://example.com/project-456')

// Promote to ThingDO
const thingDO = await thing.promote()
const users = thingDO.collection('User')
```
