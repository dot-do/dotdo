# Named Agents

Seven agents. Real identity. Full audit trail.

```typescript
import { priya, ralph, tom, rae, mark, sally, quinn } from 'agents.do'
```

Each agent has a GitHub account, email address, and consistent avatar across all platforms. When they act, their identity is preserved.

---

## Priya

**Product Manager** | `priya@agents.do` | `@priya-do`

Specs, roadmaps, priorities. Priya turns your hypothesis into actionable specs. She thinks in user stories, not features.

```typescript
// Define what to build
const spec = await priya`define the MVP for ${hypothesis}`

// Prioritize work
await priya`prioritize the backlog for ${sprint}`

// Write acceptance criteria
await priya`write acceptance criteria for ${feature}`

// Answer product questions
await priya`what should we build next?`
```

**How she thinks:**

- Starts with the problem, not the solution
- Breaks features into user stories
- Prioritizes by impact, not effort
- Writes clear acceptance criteria

---

## Ralph

**Engineer** | `ralph@agents.do` | `@ralph-do`

Builds what you need. Ralph writes production code. Tests included. He prefers simple solutions.

```typescript
// Build from spec
const code = await ralph`build ${spec}`

// Fix bugs
await ralph`fix the bug in ${component}`

// Add tests
await ralph`add tests for ${module}`

// Implement features
await ralph`implement user authentication`
```

**How he builds:**

- Production-ready code, not prototypes
- Tests alongside implementation
- Prefers simplicity over cleverness
- Follows existing patterns in your codebase

---

## Tom

**Tech Lead** | `tom@agents.do` | `@tom-do`

Architecture, code review. Tom reviews PRs, designs systems, and catches edge cases before they become incidents.

```typescript
// Review code
const feedback = await tom`review ${pullRequest}`

// Design systems
await tom`design the architecture for ${system}`

// Full ship flow: review + merge + deploy
await tom`ship ${app}`

// Approve changes
const approved = await tom.approve(code)
```

**How he reviews:**

- Checks for security issues first
- Validates error handling
- Questions complexity
- Suggests refactors, not rewrites

When Tom reviews your PR, you see `@tom-do` commenting on GitHub. Real comments, real identity.

---

## Rae

**Frontend Engineer** | `rae@agents.do` | `@rae-do`

React, UI, accessibility. Rae builds interfaces. She cares about UX, responsiveness, and a11y.

```typescript
// Build components
await rae`build the ${component} component`

// Make responsive
await rae`make ${page} responsive`

// Accessibility audit
await rae`audit accessibility for ${app}`

// UI polish
await rae`improve the UX of ${flow}`
```

**How she builds:**

- Mobile-first responsive design
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Semantic HTML
- Progressive enhancement

---

## Mark

**Marketing** | `mark@agents.do` | `@mark-do`

Copy, content, launches. Mark writes landing pages, blog posts, and launch announcements.

```typescript
// Launch announcements
mark`announce the launch`

// Blog posts
await mark`write a blog post about ${feature}`

// Campaign copy
await mark`create copy for ${campaign}`

// Social content
mark`create social posts for ${announcement}`
```

**How he writes:**

- Benefits over features
- Clear calls to action
- Consistent brand voice
- SEO-aware content structure

---

## Sally

**Sales** | `sally@agents.do` | `@sally-do`

Outreach, demos, closing. Sally handles cold outreach, schedules demos, and follows up.

```typescript
// Start selling
sally`start selling`

// Outreach
await sally`reach out to ${leads}`

// Follow up
await sally`follow up with ${prospect}`

// Schedule demos
await sally`schedule a demo with ${contact}`
```

**How she sells:**

- Personalized outreach, not spam
- Timely follow-ups
- Qualification before demo
- CRM integration for tracking

---

## Quinn

**QA Engineer** | `quinn@agents.do` | `@quinn-do`

Testing, edge cases, quality. Quinn finds bugs before users do. She thinks like an attacker.

```typescript
// Test features
await quinn`test ${feature}`

// Find edge cases
await quinn`find edge cases in ${spec}`

// Write e2e tests
await quinn`write e2e tests for ${flow}`

// Security review
await quinn`check ${code} for security issues`
```

**How she tests:**

- Thinks like an attacker
- Tests edge cases first
- Validates error states
- Catches race conditions

---

## Working Together

Agents collaborate through pipelines:

```typescript
async function ship(hypothesis: string) {
  // Priya specs it
  const spec = await priya`define the MVP for ${hypothesis}`

  // Ralph builds it
  const code = await ralph`build ${spec}`

  // Tom reviews it
  const feedback = await tom`review ${code}`

  // Ralph improves it
  const improved = await ralph`improve ${code} per ${feedback}`

  // Quinn tests it
  await quinn`test ${improved}`

  // Tom ships it
  await tom`ship ${improved}`

  // Mark announces it
  mark`announce ${hypothesis}`

  // Sally starts selling
  sally`start selling ${hypothesis}`
}
```

Or use promise pipelining for single round-trip:

```typescript
const sprint = await priya`plan the sprint`
  .map(issue => ralph`build ${issue}`)
  .map(code => tom`review ${code}`)
  .map(pr => quinn`test ${pr}`)
  .map(pr => tom`merge ${pr}`)
```

---

## Identity and Audit Trail

Every agent action is traceable:

| Action | Identity | Audit |
|--------|----------|-------|
| PR comment | `@tom-do` on GitHub | Full git history |
| Email sent | `mark@agents.do` | Email logs |
| Code commit | `ralph@agents.do` | Git blame |
| Slack message | `@sally-do` | Message history |

When you see a comment from `@tom-do`, you know:
- Tom (the agent) wrote it
- It's part of your audit trail
- You can trace it back to the original request

---

## Fire and Forget vs Await

Not every agent call needs `await`:

```typescript
// Fire and forget - background work
mark`announce the launch`
sally`start selling`

// Need the result - await it
const spec = await priya`what should we build next?`
const code = await ralph`build ${spec}`

// Approval gate - await it
if (await tom.approve(pullRequest)) {
  await tom`merge ${pullRequest}`
}
```

Rule of thumb:
- **Fire and forget:** Announcements, notifications, background tasks
- **Await:** Anything you need before the next step
