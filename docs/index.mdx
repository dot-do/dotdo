# Build your 1-Person Unicorn

Deploy a startup with product, engineering, marketing, and sales. It's Tuesday. You're one person.

```typescript
import { Startup } from 'dotdo'
import { priya, ralph, tom, mark, sally } from 'agents.do'

export class MyStartup extends Startup {
  async launch() {
    const spec = await priya`define the MVP for ${this.hypothesis}`
    const app = await ralph`build ${spec}`
    await tom`ship ${app}`
    await mark`announce the launch`
    await sally`start selling`
  }
}
```

## How It Works

dotdo is built on [Cap'n Web](https://github.com/cloudflare/capnweb)—object-capability RPC with **Promise Pipelining**.

```typescript
// This runs as a single batch, not N separate calls
const sprint = await priya`plan the sprint`
  .map(issue => ralph`build ${issue}`)
  .map(code => tom`review ${code}`)
```

The `.map()` isn't JavaScript's array method. It's a **Magic Map** that records your callback, sends it to the server, and replays it for each result. All in one network round trip.

## The Technical Foundation

**V8 Isolates + Durable Objects:** Virtual Chrome tabs with persistent state. 0ms cold starts. Runs in 300+ cities worldwide.

**38 Compat SDKs:** Use APIs you know—Supabase, MongoDB, Kafka, Redis. Same code, scales to millions of agents.

**$0 Egress:** Built on Cloudflare R2. Your data warehouse runs at a fraction of legacy costs.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install dotdo
npx dotdo init my-startup
npx dotdo dev
```

## Meet Your Team

| Agent | Role | Does |
|-------|------|------|
| **Priya** | Product | specs, roadmaps, priorities |
| **Ralph** | Engineering | builds what you need |
| **Tom** | Tech Lead | architecture, code review |
| **Mark** | Marketing | copy, content, launches |
| **Sally** | Sales | outreach, demos, closing |
| **Quinn** | QA | testing, edge cases, quality |

Each agent has real identity. When Tom reviews your PR, you see `@tom-do` commenting. They're not chatbots. They're workers.

## Human Escalation

AI does the work. Humans make the decisions.

```typescript
import { legal, ceo } from 'humans.do'

const approved = await ceo`approve the partnership`

escalation = this.HumanFunction({
  trigger: 'refund > $10000',
  role: 'senior-accountant',
  sla: '4 hours',
})
```

Messages route to Slack, email, SMS. Full audit trail.

## Why We Rebuilt Everything

Traditional infrastructure crumbles under 10,000 parallel AI agents:

- **Databases** hit connection limits
- **Filesystems** can't handle concurrent writes
- **Git servers** choke on parallel clones
- **Message queues** back up under load

We rebuilt on V8 isolates—virtual Chrome tabs with durable state, running on the edge, right next to your users.
