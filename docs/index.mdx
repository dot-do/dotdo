# Build your 1-Person Unicorn

The next billion-dollar businesses will be built by founders with AI agents, not armies of engineers.

dotdo is **Business-as-Code**. A complete runtime for autonomous businesses where AI agents do the work and humans make the decisions.

```typescript
import { Startup } from 'dotdo'
import { priya, ralph, tom, mark, sally } from 'agents.do'

export class MyStartup extends Startup {
  async launch() {
    const spec = priya`define the MVP for ${this.hypothesis}`
    let app = ralph`build ${spec}`

    do {
      app = ralph`improve ${app} per ${tom}`
    } while (!await tom.approve(app))

    mark`announce the launch`
    sally`start selling`
  }
}
```

This isn't pseudocode. This deploys. It's Tuesday. You're one person. By Friday, you have a product.

## What is dotdo?

dotdo transforms how businesses are built. Instead of hiring engineers to write code, hiring ops to run infrastructure, and hiring teams to handle operations, you write **Business-as-Code** and AI agents handle the execution.

**V8 Isolates + Durable Objects:** Virtual Chrome tabs with persistent state. 0ms cold starts. Runs in 300+ cities worldwide. No servers to manage.

**Promise Pipelining:** Express complex workflows. The system batches operations automatically. N operations execute in 1 round trip, not N.

**Named Agents:** Real workers with real identity. When Tom reviews your PR, you see `@tom-do` commenting on GitHub. Full audit trail.

**38 Compat SDKs:** Use APIs you know. Supabase, MongoDB, Kafka, Redis. Same code, but it scales to millions of agents.

## Services-as-Software

Every service your business needs, delivered as code you deploy.

| Service | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `payments.do` | Turn code into revenue |
| `auth.do` | Turn visitors into users |
| `emails.do` | Turn events into conversations |
| `agents.do` | Turn prompts into employees |
| `workflows.do` | Turn logic into automation |
| `analytics.do` | Turn data into decisions |
| `support.do` | Turn tickets into resolutions |
| `sales.do` | Turn leads into customers |

Traditional: Code **-** Infrastructure **-** Operations **-** Compliance **-** Business

dotdo: Code **-** Business *(everything else is handled)*

---

## The Key Insight

**Don't await intermediate results.** Promises batch together automatically.

When you write `priya\`define...\`` without `await`, you get a proxy object. Pass that proxy to `ralph\`build ${spec}\``, and the system knows these calls are related. They execute in a single network round trip.

```typescript
// Traditional: 6 network round trips, 6 cold starts
const spec = await priya`define the MVP`
const app = await ralph`build ${spec}`
const reviewed = await tom`review ${app}`
// ...continues serially

// dotdo: 1 network round trip (unless you need to branch)
const spec = priya`define the MVP`
const app = ralph`build ${spec}`
const reviewed = tom`review ${app}`
await sally`start selling ${reviewed}`
```

Only `await` where you need the actual value for a decision:

```typescript
do {
  app = ralph`improve ${app} per ${tom}`
} while (!await tom.approve(app))  // <-- await controls the loop
```

## Meet Your Team

| Agent | Role | What They Do |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Priya** | Product | Writes specs, prioritizes features, manages roadmaps |
| **Ralph** | Engineering | Builds features, fixes bugs, writes tests |
| **Tom** | Tech Lead | Reviews code, designs architecture, approves merges |
| **Mark** | Marketing | Writes copy, creates content, announces launches |
| **Sally** | Sales | Handles outreach, runs demos, closes deals |
| **Quinn** | QA | Tests everything, finds edge cases, verifies quality |

These aren't chatbots. They're workers with real identity. When Tom reviews your PR, you see `@tom-do` commenting. When Mark sends a launch email, it comes from `mark@agents.do`. Every action is traceable.

---

## Human Escalation

AI does the work. Humans make the decisions.

```typescript
import { legal, ceo } from 'humans.do'

const approved = await ceo`approve the partnership`

const escalation = this.HumanFunction({
  trigger: 'refund > $10000',
  role: 'senior-accountant',
  sla: '4 hours',
})
```

Messages route to Slack, email, SMS. Full audit trail. When you grow from 1 person to 10, they plug into the same system.
