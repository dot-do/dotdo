# Getting Started

**dotdo** is a Business-as-Code framework for building autonomous businesses powered by AI agents. Write TypeScript that defines your business logic, and AI agents—product managers, engineers, marketers, salespeople—execute the work for you.

## In This Guide

You'll learn how to:

- **Set up your environment** — Install dotdo and configure Cloudflare
- **Build your first startup** — Deploy a working AI-powered business in 5 minutes
- **Understand promise pipelining** — The key insight that makes dotdo fast and cheap
- **Meet your AI team** — Six named agents with real roles and real actions

<Callout type="warn">
**Before you start:** Make sure you have Node.js 18+, a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com) (free tier works), and TypeScript 5+.

## What You'll Build

It's Tuesday. You're one person. By Friday, you'll have a product, engineering, marketing, and sales team shipping code.

```typescript title="src/index.ts"
import { Startup } from 'dotdo'
import { priya, ralph, tom, mark, sally } from 'agents.do'

export class MyStartup extends Startup {
  hypothesis = 'Developers want AI teammates, not AI tools'

  async launch() {
    const spec = priya`define the MVP for ${this.hypothesis}`
    let app = ralph`build ${spec}`

    do {
      app = ralph`improve ${app} per ${tom}`
    } while (!await tom.approve(app))

    mark`announce the launch`
    sally`start selling`
  }
}
```

Notice what's missing: `await` on most lines. That's not a typo. It's the core idea.

## The Key Insight

**Don't await intermediate results.** Promises batch together automatically.

When you write `priya\`define...\`` without `await`, you get a proxy object. Pass that proxy to `ralph\`build ${spec}\``, and the system knows: "these two calls are related." They execute in a single network round trip.

Only `await` where you need the actual value:

```typescript
// This loops until Tom approves
do {
  app = ralph`improve ${app} per ${tom}`
} while (!await tom.approve(app))  // <-- await here controls the loop
```

The `await tom.approve(app)` is necessary because you need the boolean result to decide whether to continue the loop.

## Your AI Team

Six agents, each with a real role:

| Agent | Role | What They Do |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Priya** | Product | Writes specs, prioritizes features, manages roadmaps |
| **Ralph** | Engineering | Builds features, fixes bugs, writes tests |
| **Tom** | Tech Lead | Reviews code, designs architecture, approves merges |
| **Mark** | Marketing | Writes copy, creates content, announces launches |
| **Sally** | Sales | Handles outreach, runs demos, closes deals |
| **Quinn** | QA | Tests everything, finds edge cases, verifies quality |

These aren't chatbots. When Tom reviews your PR, you see `@tom-do` commenting on GitHub. When Sally closes a deal, it's in your CRM.

## Why Promise Pipelining Matters

Traditional AI orchestration:

```typescript
// 6 network round trips, 6 cold starts
const spec = await priya`define the MVP`
const app = await ralph`build ${spec}`
const reviewed = await tom`review ${app}`
const fixed = await ralph`fix ${reviewed}`
const announcement = await mark`write about ${fixed}`
await sally`start selling ${announcement}`
```

With Cap'n Web pipelining:

```typescript
// 1 network round trip (unless you need to branch)
const spec = priya`define the MVP`
const app = ralph`build ${spec}`
const reviewed = tom`review ${app}`
const fixed = ralph`fix ${reviewed}`
const announcement = mark`write about ${fixed}`
await sally`start selling ${announcement}`
```

The difference: milliseconds vs seconds. Cents vs dollars. One person vs needing a DevOps team.
