# Deployment

Deploy your do.md application to Cloudflare Workers.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- Cloudflare account configured
- Wrangler CLI installed
- Production secrets set

## Basic Deployment

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Or using wrangler directly:

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

## Environment Variables

Set production environment variables:

```bash
wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL
wrangler secret put API_SECRET
```

## Multi-Region Deployment

do.md supports multi-region deployment for low latency:

```typescript
// Configure regions
export default {
  regions: ['us-east', 'eu-west', 'ap-southeast']
}
```

## Monitoring

Monitor your deployment:

1. Check Cloudflare dashboard
2. Set up alerts
3. Review analytics

## Rollback

If something goes wrong:

```bash
wrangler rollback
```

See [API Reference](/docs/api) for configuration options.
