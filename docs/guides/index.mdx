# Guides

Practical, task-focused guides for building production dotdo applications. Each guide addresses a specific need with working code.

## Where to Start

**Just finished the quickstart?** Start with [Unit Testing](/docs/guides/testing/unit-tests) - you'll want tests before building more.

**Ready for production?** Jump to [Deployment](/docs/deployment) for the fastest path to going live.

**Coming from another framework?** Check our [Migration guides](/docs/migration) for framework-specific guidance.

**Building something complex?** Explore [Advanced Patterns](/docs/guides/advanced) for optimization and scaling techniques.

## Testing

Test dotdo applications with Vitest and the Cloudflare Workers runtime. From fast unit tests to full agent simulations.

<Cards>
  <Card title="Testing Overview" href="/docs/guides/testing">
    The testing stack: Vitest, Workers pool, Miniflare, and test fixtures.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unit Tests" href="/docs/guides/testing/unit-tests">
    Fast feedback with mocked infrastructure. Test Durable Objects without the Workers runtime.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Integration Tests" href="/docs/guides/testing/integration-tests">
    Real Workers runtime tests with actual KV, Durable Objects, and R2 bindings via Miniflare.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent Tests" href="/docs/guides/testing/agent-tests">
    Deterministic agent testing with mock providers. No LLM API calls needed.
  </Card>

## Deployment

Get your dotdo application into production on Cloudflare Workers.

<Cards>
  <Card title="Deployment" href="/docs/deployment">
    Quick path to production, scaling strategies, and multi-region setup.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sharding" href="/docs/deployment/sharding">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Geo-Replication" href="/docs/deployment/geo-replication">
    Multi-region deployment with jurisdiction controls and automatic failover.
