# Hot Tier: DO SQLite

The hot tier is your active working set. Every Durable Object has its own SQLite database with sub-100ms reads and 10GB of storage per shard.

## Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Read latency | ~50ms |
| Write latency | ~50ms |
| Storage per DO | 10GB |
| Consistency | Strong (single-writer) |
| Location | Edge (300+ cities) |

## How It Works

Each Durable Object gets its own SQLite instance:

```typescript
export class Customer extends DO {
  async getProfile() {
    // Direct SQLite query - ~50ms
    return this.db.get('profile')
  }

  async updateProfile(data: ProfileData) {
    // Transactional write
    await this.db.put('profile', data)
  }
}
```

The database is co-located with your DO. No network hop to a database server. No connection pooling. Just SQLite running next to your code.

## Storage Schema

dotdo uses a key-value schema with JSON columns:

```sql
CREATE TABLE kv (
  key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  value JSON,
  version INTEGER,
  updated_at INTEGER
);

CREATE INDEX idx_updated ON kv(updated_at);
```

This allows both point lookups and range queries:

```typescript
// Point lookup
const user = await this.db.get('user:alice')

// Range query
const recentOrders = await this.db.list({
  prefix: 'order:',
  start: 'order:2024-01',
  end: 'order:2024-12',
  limit: 100
})
```

## Automatic Archiving

When data changes, the old version streams to the warm tier:

```typescript
// This write:
await this.db.put('profile', newProfile)

// Automatically:
// 1. Writes new version to SQLite (hot)
// 2. Streams old version to Iceberg (warm)
// 3. No code changes needed
```

Cloudflare Pipelines handles the streaming. Your DO stays fast. Historical versions are queryable in the warm tier.

## 10GB Limit

Each DO has 10GB of storage. This is enough for:

- ~10 million small documents
- ~1 million medium documents
- ~100,000 large documents

If you need more, shard your data across multiple DOs:

```typescript
// Shard by customer ID
const customer = await $.Customer(customerId).get()

// Each customer has their own 10GB
// 1 million customers = 10 PB of hot storage
```

## When to Use Hot Tier

Use the hot tier for:

- **Session state** - User sessions, shopping carts
- **Real-time data** - Live dashboards, presence
- **Active records** - Current orders, active subscriptions
- **Working sets** - Data accessed in the last hour

Don't use it for:

- **Historical analytics** - Use warm/cold tiers
- **Large blobs** - Use R2 directly
- **Cross-DO queries** - Use warm tier Iceberg tables

## Cost

DO SQLite storage is included in your Durable Objects pricing. No additional charges. The real savings come from having your database at the edge - no cross-region latency, no connection overhead.
