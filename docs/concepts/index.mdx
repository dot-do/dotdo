# Concepts

These aren't just abstractions. They're the mental models that let one person run a company that would normally need fifty.

## Why Concepts Matter

Traditional software forces you to think like a computer: tables, rows, foreign keys, API endpoints. dotdo lets you think like a business owner: customers, orders, campaigns, deals.

The difference isn't just ergonomics. When your code reads like your business, AI agents can understand and operate it. When your AI team speaks the same language as your domain, they make fewer mistakes.

## The Mental Model

**Everything is a Thing.** Customers, products, orders, campaigns - they're all Things with a type, an ID, and data. No more juggling different ORMs, caches, and storage systems.

```typescript
import { Thing } from 'dotdo'

// Define a Customer thing
const customer = Thing.create('Customer', {
  id: 'cust_123',
  name: 'Acme Corp',
  plan: 'enterprise',
})

// Things are URLs - portable and linkable
console.log(customer.url) // https://things.do/Customer/cust_123
```

**Things interact through Events.** A customer signs up. An order ships. A payment fails. Events are immutable facts that describe what happened. They're your audit log, your analytics source, and your integration layer.

```typescript
// Events capture the 5W+H: who, what, when, where, why, how
$.emit('Customer.signup', {
  customer: customer.id,
  plan: 'enterprise',
  source: 'marketing-campaign',
})

// Subscribe to events anywhere in your system
$.on.Customer.signup(async ($, event) => {
  await $.send.welcome.email(event.customer)
  await mark`announce new enterprise customer`
})
```

**Events trigger Functions.** When something happens, you respond. Functions can be code, AI completions, agent workflows, or human escalations. The caller doesn't care which - they just get results.

```typescript
// Four function types, one interface
const summarize = CodeFunction(text => text.slice(0, 100))
const analyze = GenerativeFunction('Analyze this feedback')
const research = AgenticFunction(priya)
const approve = HumanFunction('legal', { sla: '4h' })

// Caller doesn't know (or care) which type
const result = await analyze(customerFeedback)
```

**Promises pipeline together.** Don't `await` intermediate results. Let the system batch multiple agent calls into single network round trips. This is why dotdo is fast.

```typescript
// This makes ONE network round trip, not three
const spec = priya`define the MVP for ${hypothesis}`
const code = ralph`build ${spec}`
const review = tom`review ${code}`

// Only await when you need the final result
const approved = await review
```

## Core Concepts

<Cards>
  <Card title="Promise Pipelining" href="/docs/concepts/promise-pipelining">
    The foundational optimization. Batch multiple agent calls into single round trips by passing unawaited promises as parameters.
  </Card>
  <Card title="The do...while Loop" href="/docs/concepts/do-loop">
    The signature pattern of dotdo. Build, review, improve, repeat - with a single await controlling the whole cycle.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Events" href="/docs/concepts/events">
    The connective tissue. Every action, every state change, every business moment captured with the 5W+H model.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Functions" href="/docs/concepts/functions">
    Four implementation types (Code, Generative, Agentic, Human) behind one interface. The caller never needs to know how it runs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Experiments" href="/docs/concepts/experiments">
    A/B testing using git semantics. Branches ARE variants - no separate experimentation system needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sqids" href="/docs/concepts/sqids">
    Compact, URL-safe identifiers for Things, Events, and References with tagged fields for self-description.
  </Card>

## Suggested Reading Order

If you're new to dotdo, start here:

1. **[Promise Pipelining](/docs/concepts/promise-pipelining)** - Understand the core performance optimization
2. **[The do...while Loop](/docs/concepts/do-loop)** - Learn the signature pattern
3. **[Events](/docs/concepts/events)** - See how business moments flow through the system
4. **[Functions](/docs/concepts/functions)** - Understand the four types of executable logic

Then, as you build:

5. **[Experiments](/docs/concepts/experiments)** - When you're ready to optimize with A/B tests
6. **[Sqids](/docs/concepts/sqids)** - When you need to understand ID conventions
