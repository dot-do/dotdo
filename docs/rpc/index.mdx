# RPC.do

RPC.do provides a powerful RPC system with promise pipelining, allowing you to chain method calls without waiting for each to resolve.

## Key Concepts

- **[Proxy Chaining](/docs/rpc/proxy-chaining)** - Chain method calls on remote objects
- **[Pipelines](/docs/rpc/pipelines)** - Batch multiple operations into single round-trips
- **[Magic Map](/docs/rpc/magic-map)** - Transform collections without awaiting
- **[Await Patterns](/docs/rpc/await-patterns)** - When to await vs when to pipeline
