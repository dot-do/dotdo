# Proxy Chaining

Chain method calls on remote objects. Each call returns a proxy that can be chained further.

```typescript
// Instead of:
const user = await rpc.getUser('alice')
const posts = await user.getPosts()
const first = await posts[0]

// Chain without awaiting intermediate results:
const first = await rpc.getUser('alice').getPosts()[0]
```

## How It Works

When you access a property or call a method on an RPC proxy, you get back another proxy - not the actual value. The chain is only resolved when you `await` the final result.

## Benefits

- **Fewer round-trips** - The entire chain is sent as one request
- **Lower latency** - No waiting between each step
- **Cleaner code** - Express intent without ceremony
