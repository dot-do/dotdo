# Pipelines

Pipelines batch multiple independent operations into a single network round-trip.

```typescript
// These three calls are batched automatically:
const [user, posts, settings] = await Promise.all([rpc.getUser('alice'), rpc.getPosts({ limit: 10 }), rpc.getSettings()])
```

## Promise Pipelining

When you chain calls, the server can start processing the next step before sending the previous result back:

```typescript
// Server processes getUser, then immediately processes getPosts
// without sending user data back first
const posts = await rpc.getUser('alice').getPosts()
```

## Batching Independent Calls

Use `Promise.all` to batch independent operations:

```typescript
// Single round-trip for all three
const [a, b, c] = await Promise.all([rpc.operationA(), rpc.operationB(), rpc.operationC()])
```
