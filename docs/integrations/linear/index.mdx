# Linear Integration

dotdo provides two ways to work with Linear-compatible APIs:

| | @dotdo/linear | linear.do |
|---|---------------|-----------|
| **Type** | OSS npm package | Managed edge service |
| **Storage** | In-memory (LinearLocal) | Durable Object SQLite |
| **Persistence** | None (resets on restart) | Full durability |
| **Use case** | Testing, prototyping | Production workloads |
| **Infrastructure** | Zero | Zero (we manage it) |
| **Install** | `npm install @dotdo/linear` | Deploy to Cloudflare |

## Quick Comparison

```typescript
// @dotdo/linear - In-memory, great for tests
import { LinearLocal } from '@dotdo/linear'

const linear = new LinearLocal()
const { team } = await linear.teamCreate({ name: 'Engineering', key: 'ENG' })
const { issue } = await linear.issueCreate({ teamId: team.id, title: 'Ship MVP' })
// Data lost on restart
```

```typescript
// linear.do - Persistent edge service
import { LinearClient } from 'linear.do'

const linear = new LinearClient('https://your-worker.workers.dev')
const { team } = await linear.teamCreate({ name: 'Engineering', key: 'ENG' })
const { issue } = await linear.issueCreate({ teamId: team.id, title: 'Ship MVP' })
// Data persists globally
```

## When to Use Each

### Use @dotdo/linear when:

- **Unit testing** - Fast, isolated tests without external dependencies
- **Prototyping** - Quick iteration without infrastructure setup
- **Edge functions** - Need Linear API but no persistence required
- **CI/CD pipelines** - Tests that need Linear semantics
- **Webhook testing** - Simulate and verify webhook handlers

<Callout type="info">
@dotdo/linear is a complete in-memory Linear implementation with time-travel queries. Perfect for tests and development, but data doesn't persist between restarts.
</Callout>

### Use linear.do when:

- **Production applications** - Real project data that must persist
- **Global edge deployment** - Data close to users worldwide
- **AI/Agent workloads** - Project management automation with agents
- **Real-time features** - Webhook events, live updates

<Callout type="info">
linear.do is Linear on the Edge - a fully managed service running on Cloudflare's global network with zero infrastructure to manage.
</Callout>

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | @dotdo/linear | linear.do |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Teams CRUD | Full | Full |
| Issues CRUD | Full | Full |
| Projects & Milestones | Full | Full |
| Cycles (Sprints) | Full | Full |
| Comments (threaded) | Full | Full |
| Labels (hierarchical) | Full | Full |
| Workflow States | Full | Full |
| Issue Relations | Full | Full |
| Search | Full | Full + vector |
| Webhooks | Simulation | Real + simulation |
| Time-Travel Queries | Full | Full |
| Transactions | N/A | ACID |
| Change Streams | N/A | Real-time |
| Wire Protocol | N/A | GraphQL compatible |

    <h3 className="font-semibold">@dotdo/linear</h3>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">In-memory Linear for testing and development</p>

    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">Managed Linear on the edge for production</p>
  </a>
</div>

## Migration Path

Start with `@dotdo/linear` for development, then upgrade to `linear.do` for production:

```typescript
// Development (package)
import { LinearLocal } from '@dotdo/linear'
const linear = new LinearLocal()

// Production (service) - same API!
import { LinearClient } from 'linear.do'
const linear = new LinearClient('https://your-linear.workers.dev')

// Your application code stays the same
const { team } = await linear.teamCreate({ name: 'Engineering', key: 'ENG' })
const { issue } = await linear.issueCreate({
  teamId: team.id,
  title: 'Implement authentication',
  priority: 1,
})
```

Both packages share the same Linear-compatible API, making migration seamless.

## Connecting to Real Linear

Both packages can also proxy to the real Linear API:

```typescript
import { LinearClient } from '@dotdo/linear'

// Connect to real Linear API
const linear = new LinearClient({ apiKey: env.LINEAR_API_KEY })

// All requests go to api.linear.app
const { issue } = await linear.issueCreate({
  teamId: 'team-uuid',
  title: 'Production issue',
})
```
