# Inngest Integration

dotdo provides two ways to work with Inngest-compatible durable function APIs:

| | @dotdo/inngest | inngest.do |
|---|----------------|------------|
| **Type** | OSS npm package | Managed edge service |
| **Storage** | In-memory or DO SQLite | Durable Object SQLite |
| **Persistence** | Configurable | Full durability |
| **Use case** | Testing, migration | Production workloads |
| **Infrastructure** | Zero | Zero (we manage it) |
| **Install** | `npm install @dotdo/inngest` | Deploy to Cloudflare |

## Quick Comparison

```typescript
// @dotdo/inngest - Drop-in replacement for Inngest SDK
import { Inngest } from '@dotdo/inngest'

const inngest = new Inngest({ id: 'my-app' })

const fn = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: 'process-order' },
  { event: 'order/created' },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    await step.run('validate', () => validateOrder(event.data))
    await step.sleep('wait', '1h')
    await step.run('fulfill', () => fulfillOrder(event.data))
  }
)
```

```typescript
// inngest.do - Native edge durable functions
import { InngestDO } from 'inngest.do'

export class OrderProcessor extends InngestDO {
  async processOrder(event) {
    await this.step.run('validate', () => validateOrder(event.data))
    await this.step.sleep('wait', '1h')
    await this.step.run('fulfill', () => fulfillOrder(event.data))
  }
}
```

## When to Use Each

### Use @dotdo/inngest when:

- **Migrating from Inngest** - Drop-in replacement with same API
- **Unit testing** - In-memory mode for fast, isolated tests
- **Gradual adoption** - Test Inngest patterns without changing infrastructure
- **Existing codebase** - Keep familiar API while moving to edge

<Callout type="info">
@dotdo/inngest is a complete Inngest SDK replacement. Use it when you need the familiar Inngest API for migration or testing scenarios.
</Callout>

### Use inngest.do when:

- **Production workloads** - Full durability with Durable Objects
- **Edge-native deployment** - Built for Cloudflare Workers from the ground up
- **Zero infrastructure** - No external services to manage
- **Global distribution** - Functions execute in 300+ cities
- **Unlimited duration** - No time limits on function execution

<Callout type="info">
inngest.do is edge-native durable functions built on Cloudflare. Use it for production workloads that need durability, global distribution, and zero cold starts.
</Callout>

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | @dotdo/inngest | inngest.do |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| Event-driven functions | Full | Full |
| Cron triggers | Full | Full |
| step.run (durable steps) | Full | Full |
| step.sleep (durable sleep) | Full | Full |
| step.waitForEvent | Full | Full |
| step.invoke | Full | Full |
| step.parallel | Full | Full |
| Middleware | Full | Full |
| Rate limiting | Full | Full |
| Concurrency control | Full | Full |
| Batching | Full | Full |
| Cancellation | Full | Full |
| In-memory mode | Yes | No |
| DO SQLite storage | Optional | Built-in |
| Cold start | Depends on storage | 0ms |
| Max duration | Depends on storage | Unlimited |

  </a>
</div>

## Migration Path

Start with `@dotdo/inngest` as a drop-in replacement, then migrate to `inngest.do` for production:

```typescript
// Phase 1: Replace Inngest SDK with @dotdo/inngest
// Before
import { Inngest } from 'inngest'
// After
import { Inngest } from '@dotdo/inngest'

// Your code stays exactly the same
const inngest = new Inngest({ id: 'my-app' })

const fn = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: 'my-function' },
  { event: 'my/event' },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    const result = await step.run('step-1', () => doSomething(event.data))
    await step.sleep('wait', '1h')
    return result
  }
)
```

```typescript
// Phase 2: Move to inngest.do for production edge deployment
import { InngestDO } from 'inngest.do'

export class MyFunction extends InngestDO {
  triggers = [{ event: 'my/event' }]

  async handler({ event }) {
    const result = await this.step.run('step-1', () => doSomething(event.data))
    await this.step.sleep('wait', '1h')
    return result
  }
}
```

## Why Not Just Use Inngest?

**Inngest is great.** Event-driven durable functions with a beautiful API.

**But it's another service.** Events leave your infrastructure, hop to Inngest's servers, then back to your workers. Extra latency. Extra cost. Extra vendor dependency.

| Aspect | Inngest | dotdo |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Events leave infra** | Yes (to Inngest servers) | No |
| **Cold start** | ~50ms | 0ms (V8 isolates) |
| **Global edge** | 5 regions | 300+ cities |
| **Max duration** | 2 hours | Unlimited |
| **Pricing** | Per-step billing | Included |
| **Self-hosted** | Enterprise only | Always |

Both `@dotdo/inngest` and `inngest.do` run on your infrastructure - events never leave your Workers.
