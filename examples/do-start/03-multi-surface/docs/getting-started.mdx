# Getting Started

Welcome to the multi-surface example! This guide will help you understand how the five surfaces work together.

## Running the Example

```bash
# Navigate to the example
cd examples/do-start/03-multi-surface

# Start the dev server
do start
```

## Available Surfaces

After starting, you'll have access to:

| Surface | URL | File |
|---------|-----|------|
| Site | http://localhost:4000/ | Site.mdx |
| App | http://localhost:4000/app | App.tsx |
| Admin | http://localhost:4000/admin | Admin.tsx |
| Docs | http://localhost:4000/docs | Docs.mdx |
| Blog | http://localhost:4000/blog | Blog.mdx |

## How Discovery Works

The CLI automatically discovers surface files:

1. Checks root directory for `{Surface}.tsx` or `{Surface}.mdx`
2. Falls back to `.do/` directory
3. TSX takes priority over MDX for same-named files

## Adding Content

### Documentation

Add new docs to the `docs/` folder:

```mdx
---
title: My New Guide
order: 2
---

# My New Guide

Content here...
```

### Blog Posts

Add new posts to the `blog/` folder:

```mdx
---
title: My Post Title
date: 2026-01-15
author: Your Name
---

# My Post Title

Content here...
```

## Next Steps

- Explore each surface's source code
- Try modifying a surface and see hot reload
- Add new content to `docs/` or `blog/`
