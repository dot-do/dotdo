# Hello World - Our First Post

Welcome to the Acme blog! This is our very first post, demonstrating how the blog surface works in a multi-surface dotdo application.

## What is Multi-Surface?

Multi-surface architecture lets you build complete applications with distinct frontends:

- **Site** - Your marketing and landing pages
- **App** - The main user dashboard
- **Admin** - Administrative controls
- **Docs** - Documentation center
- **Blog** - Company blog (you are here!)

## Why It Matters

Traditional approaches require separate repositories or complex monorepo setups. With dotdo, everything lives together:

```
my-project/
  Site.mdx          # Marketing
  App.tsx           # Dashboard
  Admin.tsx         # Admin
  Docs.mdx          # Documentation
  Blog.mdx          # Blog
  docs/             # Doc content
  blog/             # Blog posts
```

All sharing the same:
- Backend (Durable Objects)
- Authentication
- Database
- Configuration

## Getting Started

Run this example yourself:

```bash
cd examples/do-start/03-multi-surface
do start
```

Then visit:
- http://localhost:4000/ (Site)
- http://localhost:4000/app (App)
- http://localhost:4000/admin (Admin)
- http://localhost:4000/docs (Docs)
- http://localhost:4000/blog (Blog)

Stay tuned for more updates!
