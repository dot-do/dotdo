# Introducing Multi-Surface Architecture

We are excited to announce the general availability of multi-surface architecture in dotdo. This feature allows you to build complete applications with distinct frontend surfaces, all sharing the same backend.

## The Problem

Traditional web applications struggle with a common challenge: how do you serve different experiences to different audiences without duplicating infrastructure?

- Marketing teams want a fast, SEO-optimized landing page
- Product teams want a feature-rich dashboard
- Admin teams need specialized tooling
- Users need documentation and support content

Previously, this meant:

- Multiple repositories
- Separate deployment pipelines
- Duplicated authentication
- Inconsistent data access

## The Solution: Surfaces

With dotdo surfaces, you define each frontend as a simple file:

```
my-app/
  Site.mdx          # Marketing at /
  App.tsx           # Dashboard at /app
  Admin.tsx         # Admin panel at /admin
  Docs.mdx          # Docs at /docs
  Blog.mdx          # Blog at /blog
```

Each surface is:

- **Independently developed** - Teams work on their surface
- **Automatically routed** - No configuration needed
- **Sharing the same backend** - One set of Durable Objects
- **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support

## Zero Configuration

The most powerful feature is that no configuration is required. Run `do start` and all surfaces are discovered and served automatically:

```bash
$ do start

Discovered surfaces:
  Site.mdx   -> /
  App.tsx    -> /app
  Admin.tsx  -> /admin
  Docs.mdx   -> /docs
  Blog.mdx   -> /blog

Server running at http://localhost:4000
```

## Content Directories

For content-heavy surfaces like Docs and Blog, simply create matching directories:

```
docs/
  getting-started.mdx    # /docs/getting-started
  api.mdx                # /docs/api
  surfaces.mdx           # /docs/surfaces

blog/
  hello-world.mdx        # /blog/hello-world
  announcement.mdx       # /blog/announcement
```

Content files are automatically routed based on their path.

## Shared Durable Objects

The real power comes from shared backend logic. Define a DO in any surface file:

```tsx
// In App.tsx
export class Workspace extends DO {
  async createProject(name: string) {
    return this.things.create({ $type: 'Project', name })
  }
}
```

This DO is now available:

- As a REST API at `/Workspace/:id`
- From any surface via RPC
- With automatic persistence

## Try It Today

Get started with the multi-surface example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dotdo/dotdo
cd dotdo/examples/do-start/03-multi-surface
do start
```

Then visit:

- http://localhost:4000/ (Site)
- http://localhost:4000/app (App)
- http://localhost:4000/admin (Admin)
- http://localhost:4000/docs (Docs)
- http://localhost:4000/blog (Blog)

## What's Next

We are working on:

- **Surface composition** - Embed surfaces within surfaces
- **Surface middleware** - Auth, logging, analytics per surface
- **Surface-specific configuration** - Fine-grained control

Stay tuned for more updates!
